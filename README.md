HorizontalPager for Mono for Android
==============

Check [HorizontalListView](https://github.com/Cheesebaron/Cheesebaron.HorizontalListView), for a similar implementation with AdapterView (better memory footprint).

This is a port from the code made by [ysamlan](https://github.com/ysamlan), which originally is made by Marc Reichelt as [RealViewSwitcher](http://marcreichelt.blogspot.com/2010/09/android-use-realviewswitcher-to-switch.html).
