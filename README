HorizontalPager for Mono for Android
==============
((NOTE)) While the Xamarin people are implementing support for usage of arbitrary jar files, this might be one of the sollutions to make a horizontal pager. When they start supporting it using Fragments and [ViewPager](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/08/horizontal-view-swiping-with-viewpager.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FhsDu+%28Android+Developers+Blog%29) would probably be a much nicer way to achieve this.

This is a port from the code made by [ysamlan](https://github.com/ysamlan), which originally is made by Marc Reichelt as [RealViewSwitcher](http://marcreichelt.blogspot.com/2010/09/android-use-realviewswitcher-to-switch.html).
